# RemocodeBrowser

RemocodeBrowser is a development fork of [BrowserOS](https://github.com/browseros-ai/BrowserOS), maintained by [BlueOriginAI](https://github.com/BlueOriginAI). It keeps the Chromium browser, AI assistant, local MCP tools, and agent cockpit as the starting point for our own browser development.

Repository: https://github.com/BlueOriginAI/RemocodeBrowser

## Development status

- Main product: **RemocodeBrowser**. Agent-focused variant: **RemocodeBrowser neo**.
- Initial changes cover product descriptors, macOS bundle/profile identities, extension names, page titles, and visible sidebar names.
- Internal `browseros` / `browserclaw` build keys and APIs remain compatible with upstream.
- This is a source fork, not a published installer. Icons, cloud service integrations, release signing, Windows/Linux install identities, and update infrastructure still need fork-specific work before distribution.

Read [our development guide](docs/remocode-development.md) before building. The [original upstream README](README.upstream.md) is preserved for attribution and architecture reference; its download links, services, and benchmarks refer to BrowserOS, not to a RemocodeBrowser release.
